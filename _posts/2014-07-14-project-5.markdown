description: We look at brandsâ€™ impact on workers across the supply chain. These include policies and practices on child labour, forced labour, worker safety, freedom of association (the right to join a union), gender equality and payment of a living wage. We consider how well a brand ensures that its policies are implemented do they empower workers, have supportive supplier relationships, or conduct meaningful audits? Do their practices protect workers from the impacts of COVID-19?
