description: We consider each brand’s resource use and waste management, and their policies to address energy use and carbon emissions, impacts on water, microfibre pollution and chemical use and disposal. We also consider how well a brand traces its animal products and its animal welfare policies. We identify the use of fur, angora, down feather, shearling, karakul and exotic animal skin and hair. We also consider wool use including ‘mulesing’ and whether and how the brand uses leather.
