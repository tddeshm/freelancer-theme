description: Green Tag’s rating system is based on three categories people, planet, and policies. We begin analyzing companies by starting them off at five stars in each category. From there, we remove stars according to negative information that we come across in our research process. The three main databases that we use to gather information are Good On You​, ​Ethical Consumer​, and ​Shop Ethical​. Finally, after giving each company a category rating, we assign an overall Green Score which is the average of the three category scores.
